# 🌋 Volcano Detection on Venus using Machine Learning Models 🌑

Welcome to the **Volcano Detection on Venus (VDV)** project! This repository contains the code and workflows for classifying the presence of volcanic structures on Venus using data collected from NASA's Magellan mission. This project aims to identify and classify volcanic features from radar images of Venus, contributing to the understanding of planetary geology.

The work uses classic machine learning algorithms to address a classification problem regarding the presence of volcanoes on the surface of Venus, using images generated by the Magellan spacecraft. Preprocessing techniques are discussed, such as the use of Gaussian filters and Wavelets. Additionally, intrinsic augmentation of the images is performed to balance the classes, avoiding imbalance in classifier performance. The models used were SVM, Decision Trees, XGBoost, and KNN. A final result of 95% recall on the test set was achieved, demonstrating the effectiveness of the techniques used.

## 📊 Data

The data for this project comes from the **Magellan mission**, which provided radar imaging of the Venusian surface. The processed version of the dataset can be accessed from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 

### Dataset Structure:
- **Radar Images**: `.png` or `.jpg` files representing Venus' surface.
- **Annotations**: `.txt` files describing volcanic structures.
  
Each image has a corresponding annotation file for detailed analysis.

## 🔬 Methodology

The workflow follows a multi-step approach combining classical image processing techniques with deep learning:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize image data and clean noise from radar images.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract visual features.
3. **Model Training**: Train models to detect volcanoes based on labeled examples.
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.
